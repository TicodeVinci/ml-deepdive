# Machine Learning Foundations

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. At its core, ML is about creating algorithms that can automatically identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions.

### What Makes Machine Learning Different?
Traditional programming requires explicit rules to be coded for every situation. Machine learning, however, learns these rules automatically from data. This makes it particularly valuable when:

* The problem is too complex for traditional programming
* The patterns change frequently
* The solution needs to be personalized at scale
* There's a wealth of historical data available

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**
   * Works with labeled data
   * The algorithm learns to map inputs to known outputs

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   * Works with unlabeled data
   * Finds hidden patterns or structures in data


3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   * Learns through trial and error
   * Receives rewards or penalties for actions

## The Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
The foundation of any ML project starts with data. Key considerations include:

* Data quality and quantity requirements
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Data splitting (training/validation/test sets)

### 2. Model Development

Building effective ML models involves:

* Selecting appropriate algorithms
* Training the model
* Tuning hyperparameters
* Validating performance

Best practices include:
- Starting with simple models
- Using [[cross-validation]]
- Monitoring for [[overfitting]]/underfitting
- Implementing proper evaluation metrics

### 3. Model Evaluation
Crucial metrics and considerations:

* Classification metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

* [[Regression]] metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
