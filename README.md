Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey through machine learning! This repository serves as both a learning diary and a resource collection for others interested in ML.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository it's been created to share the progress of my 14 days challenge studying Machine Learning that I started on X. 

I will use it to publish: 

- Notes from my Obsidian Vault
- Resources 
- Exercises
